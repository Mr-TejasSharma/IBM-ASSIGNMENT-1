      <h2>Wikipedia Clone â€“ An Open Encyclopedia</h2>
      <p>
        This Wikipedia Clone is a minimal, responsive, and visually appealing recreation of the world's largest collaborative encyclopedia. It has been <strong>developed by IBM</strong> and <strong>coded by Tejas Sharma</strong> as a demonstration of modern web development using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is the largest and most-read reference work in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Launched in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia now exists in over 300 languages and hosts millions of articles covering nearly every imaginable topic.
      </p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Wikipedia was officially launched on January 15, 2001. Initially intended to supplement the expert-reviewed Nupedia, Wikipedia soon outgrew it, becoming the dominant project of the Wikimedia Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Wikipedia has evolved into a trusted information source, playing a vital role in education, media, and research around the world.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Completely free and open to use</li>
        <li>Editable by anyone with internet access</li>
        <li>Available in multiple languages</li>
        <li>Backed by a global community of volunteers</li>
        <li>Supported by donations and grants</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
      <p>
        This clone version is built using basic front-end technologies. Here is the breakdown:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For structuring content</li>
        <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> For styling and responsive layout</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For dark mode interactivity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Community and Editing</h3>
      <p>
        One of the strongest aspects of Wikipedia is its community. Editors work together to maintain neutrality, improve content accuracy, and cite reliable sources. Wikipedia's reliability has improved over time due to stringent guidelines and peer editing.
      </p>

      <h3>Impact and Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        Wikipedia has reshaped how the world accesses information. It serves as a resource for students, professionals, journalists, and curious minds. Despite challenges regarding misinformation, vandalism, and funding, it remains a beacon of free knowledge.
      </p>

      <h3>Wikipedia Clone Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This clone project aims to demonstrate how modern, responsive, and interactive websites can be created using core web technologies without relying on frameworks. It serves as a portfolio piece and a learning resource for beginners.
